# Playwright Environment Skill

This skill resolves the **browser execution context** before any MCP Playwright
interaction. It must be loaded before `playwright-session` and before any
browser tool call.

This skill does **not** store secrets. It resolves non-secret settings and
validates that secret environment variables are exported and readable.

---

## Resolution Order

Resolve each setting in this order, stopping at the first source that provides
a value:

1. Shell environment variable (e.g. `RALPH_APP_URL`)
2. `playwright-env.local.md` in `<basePath>` (gitignored, never committed)
3. Non-secret values already written in `.ralph-state.json → playwrightEnv`
   ⚠️ **State fallback warning**: values from `.ralph-state.json` may be stale
   from a previous session. **Always check the `resolvedAt` timestamp**:
   - If `resolvedAt` is older than ~2 hours, treat as low-confidence and prefer sources 1–2.
   - If `resolvedAt` is missing entirely, discard the cached block and re-resolve from sources 1–2.
   - Never rely on state-file values for security-sensitive settings
     (`authMode`, `tokenBootstrapRule`). Those must always come from sources 1–2.
   ⚠️ **Circular fallback prevention**: if sources 1 and 2 are both absent and
   source 3 is the only available value, emit a warning before using it:
   ```
   WARNING: playwright-env resolved from state cache only (no env vars, no local md).
   resolvedAt: <timestamp>. Values may be stale. Proceeding with low confidence.
   ```
   This prevents a silent feedback loop where stale state values are treated as
   authoritative across multiple task invocations.
4. `requirements.md → Verification Contract → Entry points` (URL fallback only)
5. `ESCALATE` — stop and ask the human

## Settings Reference

### Core

| Setting | Env var | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| App URL | `RALPH_APP_URL` | — | **Required. No default.** |
| App environment | `RALPH_APP_ENV` | `local` | `local`, `staging`, `production` |
| Allow writes | `RALPH_ALLOW_WRITE` | `false` (staging/prod) / `true` (local) | Override explicitly for non-local |
| Browser | `RALPH_BROWSER` | `chromium` | `chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit` |
| Headless | `RALPH_HEADLESS` | `true` | Set `false` for local debug |
| Viewport | `RALPH_VIEWPORT` | `desktop` | `desktop`, `tablet`, `mobile`, or `1280x800` |
| Locale | `RALPH_LOCALE` | `en-US` | Affects date formats, text content assertions |
| Timezone | `RALPH_TIMEZONE` | `UTC` | Affects time-sensitive assertions |
| Isolated mode | `RALPH_PLAYWRIGHT_ISOLATED` | `true` | Launches MCP with `--isolated` flag (ephemeral profile, no disk cache). Set `false` only when auth persistence between steps is required and you explicitly manage the user-data-dir. |

### Authentication

| Setting | Env var | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Auth mode | `RALPH_AUTH_MODE` | `none`, `form`, `token`, `cookie`, `oauth`, `basic`, `storage-state` |
| Login URL | `RALPH_LOGIN_URL` | Optional. Defaults to `appUrl` if not set |
| Username / email | `RALPH_LOGIN_USER` | Used by `form` and `basic` modes |
| Password | `RALPH_LOGIN_PASS` | Used by `form` and `basic` modes |
| Auth token | `RALPH_AUTH_TOKEN` | Used by `token` mode |
| Session cookie name | `RALPH_SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` | Used by `cookie` mode |
| Session cookie value | `RALPH_SESSION_COOKIE_VALUE` | Used by `cookie` mode |
| Storage state path | `RALPH_STORAGE_STATE_PATH` | Used by `storage-state` mode. Must be a readable local file |
| Test user role | `RALPH_USER_ROLE` | Optional. `admin`, `editor`, `viewer`, etc. Documents intent |
| Token bootstrap rule | `tokenBootstrapRule` | Required for `token` mode. `localStorage` or `authorization-header`. Set in `playwright-env.local.md`. |
| Token localStorage key | `tokenLocalStorageKey` | Required when `tokenBootstrapRule=localStorage`. The exact key the app uses to store the token in `localStorage` (check app source). Set in `playwright-env.local.md`. |

### App state / seed

| Setting | Env var | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Seed command | `RALPH_SEED_COMMAND` | Optional shell command to prepare app state before verification |
| Tenant / workspace | `RALPH_TENANT` | Optional. For multi-tenant apps |
| Feature flags | `RALPH_FEATURE_FLAGS` | Optional. Comma-separated list of flags to enable |

---

## Auth Mode Rules

### `none`
No credentials needed. Use for public UIs or auth-disabled dev environments.
Required: `appUrl`

### `form`
Agent completes a login form in the browser.
Required: `appUrl`, `RALPH_LOGIN_USER` value, `RALPH_LOGIN_PASS` value
Optional: `RALPH_LOGIN_URL` (separate login URL)

Resolution check:
```bash
[ -n "$RALPH_LOGIN_USER" ] && [ -n "$RALPH_LOGIN_PASS" ] || emit ESCALATE
```

### `token`
Agent injects an auth token to bootstrap authenticated state.
Required: `appUrl`, `RALPH_AUTH_TOKEN` value, `tokenBootstrapRule` in `playwright-env.local.md`
See `playwright-session.skill.md → Auth Flow → token` for the 3 injection patterns.

### `cookie`
Agent injects a pre-issued session cookie directly into the browser context.
Required: `appUrl`, `RALPH_SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`, `RALPH_SESSION_COOKIE_VALUE`

### `basic`
HTTP Basic Auth via URL or Authorization header.
Required: `appUrl`, `RALPH_LOGIN_USER`, `RALPH_LOGIN_PASS`

### `storage-state`
Agent loads a pre-authenticated browser state from a local file.
Required: `appUrl`, `RALPH_STORAGE_STATE_PATH` pointing to a readable JSON file

Resolution check:
```bash
[ -f "$RALPH_STORAGE_STATE_PATH" ] || emit ESCALATE
```

### `oauth` / `sso`
External IdP flows the agent cannot complete autonomously.
Resolution: use `storage-state` with a pre-authenticated session, or emit `ESCALATE`.

## Resolution Step — Build RESOLVED_APP_URL and RESOLVED_SEED_COMMAND

Before the connectivity check or seed execution, resolve the final values by
applying the 5-source resolution order. **All subsequent steps must use these
resolved variables**, never the raw env vars directly.

```bash
# --- Resolve appUrl ---
RESOLVED_APP_URL="${RALPH_APP_URL:-}"

# Source 2: playwright-env.local.md
if [ -z "$RESOLVED_APP_URL" ] && [ -f "<basePath>/playwright-env.local.md" ]; then
  RESOLVED_APP_URL=$(grep -E '^appUrl:' "<basePath>/playwright-env.local.md" \
    | head -1 | sed 's/^appUrl:[[:space:]]*//')
fi

# Source 3: .ralph-state.json cache (stale-check: only if resolvedAt < 2h)
if [ -z "$RESOLVED_APP_URL" ] && [ -f "<basePath>/.ralph-state.json" ]; then
  CACHED_URL=$(jq -r '.playwrightEnv.appUrl // empty' "<basePath>/.ralph-state.json" 2>/dev/null)
  RESOLVED_AT=$(jq -r '.playwrightEnv.resolvedAt // empty' "<basePath>/.ralph-state.json" 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -n "$CACHED_URL" ] && [ -n "$RESOLVED_AT" ]; then
    CACHE_AGE=$(( $(date +%s) - $(date -d "$RESOLVED_AT" +%s 2>/dev/null || echo 0) ))
    if [ "$CACHE_AGE" -lt 7200 ]; then
      RESOLVED_APP_URL="$CACHED_URL"
      echo "WARNING: playwright-env resolved appUrl from state cache only. resolvedAt: $RESOLVED_AT. Values may be stale." >&2
    fi
  fi
fi

# Source 4: requirements.md Entry points
if [ -z "$RESOLVED_APP_URL" ] && [ -f "<basePath>/requirements.md" ]; then
  RESOLVED_APP_URL=$(grep -A5 'Entry points' "<basePath>/requirements.md" \
    | grep -oE 'https?://[^[:space:]]+' | head -1)
fi

# Source 5: ESCALATE
if [ -z "$RESOLVED_APP_URL" ]; then
  echo "ESCALATE: appUrl not resolved from any source (env, local.md, state cache, requirements.md)" >&2
  exit 1
fi

# --- Resolve seedCommand ---
RESOLVED_SEED_COMMAND="${RALPH_SEED_COMMAND:-}"

# Source 2: playwright-env.local.md
if [ -z "$RESOLVED_SEED_COMMAND" ] && [ -f "<basePath>/playwright-env.local.md" ]; then
  RESOLVED_SEED_COMMAND=$(grep -E '^seedCommand:' "<basePath>/playwright-env.local.md" \
    | head -1 | sed 's/^seedCommand:[[:space:]]*//')
fi
# (seedCommand has no state-cache fallback — it is not written to .ralph-state.json)
```

---

## Connectivity Check (MANDATORY — step 1 after appUrl resolved)

Before running the seed command or writing state, verify the app is reachable.
Use `$RESOLVED_APP_URL` — **not** `$RALPH_APP_URL` — so the check works
regardless of which source provided the URL.

```bash
curl -sf --max-time 5 "$RESOLVED_APP_URL" -o /dev/null \
  && echo APP_REACHABLE \
  || echo APP_NOT_REACHABLE
```

```
APP_REACHABLE     → proceed to Seed Command step
APP_NOT_REACHABLE → emit ESCALATE and stop:

ESCALATE
  reason: app-not-reachable
  url: <resolved appUrl>
  appEnv: <resolved appEnv>
  diagnosis:
    - local: Is the dev server running? (npm run dev / docker compose up)
    - staging: Is the deployment healthy? Check CI/CD pipeline.
    - production: Is the service up? Check status page.
  resolution: Start the app, then re-run the VE task.
```

---

## Seed Command (MANDATORY order — step 2, after connectivity check)

If `$RESOLVED_SEED_COMMAND` is non-empty (resolved from `RALPH_SEED_COMMAND`
or `seedCommand` in `playwright-env.local.md`):

```
appEnv = local OR staging  → run seed command
appEnv = production        → SKIP — never seed production
```

```bash
# Run via bash -lc to correctly handle commands with arguments or spaces
# (e.g. "npm run seed:e2e -- --env=staging" will be handled correctly)
bash -lc "$RESOLVED_SEED_COMMAND" && echo SEED_OK || echo SEED_FAILED
```

```
SEED_OK     → proceed to write playwrightEnv to state
SEED_FAILED → emit ESCALATE and stop:

ESCALATE
  reason: seed-command-failed
  command: <RESOLVED_SEED_COMMAND value>
  resolution: Fix the seed command, then re-run the VE task.
```

**Why this order matters**: the seed command prepares the app state (database
records, fixtures, feature flags). Running it after the browser is open, or
skipping it entirely, produces incorrect test state.

---

## Module System Detection (MANDATORY — step 3, before writing infrastructure files)

Before generating any TypeScript file that resolves paths at module level
(`playwright.config.ts`, `global.setup.ts`, `global.teardown.ts`, etc.),
detect the project's module system:

```bash
# Search for the nearest package.json walking up from the spec's base path
_pkg=$(dir="<basePath>"; while [ "$dir" != "/" ]; do
  [ -f "$dir/package.json" ] && echo "$dir/package.json" && break
  dir=$(dirname "$dir")
done)
MODULE_TYPE=$([ -n "$_pkg" ] && jq -r '.type // "commonjs"' "$_pkg" 2>/dev/null || echo "commonjs")
echo "Project module type: $MODULE_TYPE"
```

Write result to `.ralph-state.json` alongside `playwrightEnv`:

```bash
jq --arg mt "$MODULE_TYPE" '.playwrightEnv.moduleType = $mt' \
  <basePath>/.ralph-state.json > /tmp/state.json && mv /tmp/state.json <basePath>/.ralph-state.json
```

Values: `"module"` (ESM) or `"commonjs"` (CJS, the default if absent).

**Path resolution rules based on module type:**

| `moduleType` | Pattern to use | Never use |
|---|---|---|
| `"module"` (ESM) | `import { fileURLToPath } from 'url'` + `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` | `__dirname` bare, `process.cwd()`, `new URL(...).pathname` |
| `"commonjs"` (CJS) | `__dirname` directly | `import.meta.url` |

Persist in `.progress.md` so subsequent tasks in the same spec reuse the result
without re-detecting:
```markdown
### Module System
- Project type: ESM | CJS (detected from package.json)
- Path resolution: fileURLToPath(import.meta.url) | __dirname
```

> **See also**: `references/e2e-anti-patterns.md → TypeScript Module System Anti-Patterns`
> for the full table of common mistakes and their correct alternatives.

---

## Write State

Only after connectivity check passes, seed command succeeds (if set), and module type is detected:

```bash
jq '.playwrightEnv = {
  "appUrl": "<resolved>",
  "appEnv": "<resolved>",
  "authMode": "<resolved>",
  "allowWrite": <true|false>,
  "browser": "<resolved>",
  "headless": <true|false>,
  "viewport": "<resolved>",
  "locale": "<resolved>",
  "timezone": "<resolved>",
  "isolated": <true|false>,
  "moduleType": "<module|commonjs>",
  "resolvedAt": "<ISO 8601 timestamp — e.g. 2026-04-01T14:30:00Z>"
}' <basePath>/.ralph-state.json > /tmp/state.json && mv /tmp/state.json <basePath>/.ralph-state.json
```

**Never write passwords, tokens, cookies, or any secret value to `.ralph-state.json`.**

---

## `playwright-env.local.md` Format

Create in `<basePath>/playwright-env.local.md` and add to `.gitignore`.
**Never put actual passwords, tokens, or cookies in this file.**

```markdown
# Playwright Env — local config (gitignored, never commit)

appUrl: http://localhost:3000
appEnv: local
authMode: form
loginUrl: /login
userRole: admin

loginUserVar: RALPH_LOGIN_USER
loginPassVar: RALPH_LOGIN_PASS

# For token mode — required if authMode is token:
# tokenBootstrapRule: localStorage        # or: authorization-header
# tokenLocalStorageKey: auth_token        # exact key the app uses in localStorage (check app source)

# Isolated mode (default: true)
# isolated: true    # ephemeral browser profile, no disk cache between sessions (recommended)
# isolated: false   # persistent profile — only use when you need cross-step auth persistence

allowWrite: true
browser: chromium
headless: true
viewport: desktop
locale: es-ES
timezone: Europe/Madrid

# seedCommand: npm run seed:e2e
# tenant: acme-corp
# featureFlags: new-dashboard,beta-reports
```

---

## Safety Rules

- **`allowWrite` defaults to `false` for `staging` and `production`** unless explicitly overridden.
- **`production` environment**: require explicit human confirmation before any mutating action, even if `allowWrite=true`.
- **Never log or persist secrets** in progress files, state files, screenshots, commit messages, or VERIFICATION signals.
- **Seed command** runs only in `local` or `staging`. Never in `production`.
- **Feature flags** are informational — agent notes them but does not modify app config.
- **`isolated` defaults to `true`**. The persistent `mcp-chrome` profile accumulates HTTP disk cache across sessions, which can cause stale-cache test contamination. Use `isolated: false` only when you explicitly need auth state to persist between separate VE tasks, and you manage cleanup manually.

---

## Missing Context — ESCALATE

```
ESCALATE
  reason: browser verification context incomplete
  missing:
    - appUrl        (RALPH_APP_URL not set, not in playwright-env.local.md, not in requirements.md)
    - credentials   (RALPH_LOGIN_USER / RALPH_LOGIN_PASS not exported)
    - storage-state (RALPH_STORAGE_STATE_PATH file not found)
  required_for: [AC-x.y, AC-x.z]
  resolution:
    1. Create <basePath>/playwright-env.local.md (see playwright-env.local.md.example)
    2. Export missing env vars in your shell before re-running
    3. For oauth/sso: prepare a storage-state file with RALPH_STORAGE_STATE_PATH
```

---

## Domain-Specific Resources

After resolving the environment, check if the project targets a specific platform
that has a dedicated selector map skill. Load the appropriate skill alongside
this one to ensure correct selectors and navigation patterns.

| Platform | Skill to load | Key content |
|---|---|---|
| Home Assistant | `skills/e2e/examples/homeassistant-selector-map.skill.md` | HA sidebar navigation (`data-panel-id`), shadow DOM traversal, `data-testid` conventions, HA-specific anti-patterns (no `entity_id` in selectors, no CSS class selectors, no `waitForTimeout`) |
| Generic web app | `skills/e2e/selector-map.skill.md` | Base selector hierarchy and utilities |

> **Why this matters**: Platform-specific skills contain anti-patterns that cause
> test failures unique to that platform. For example, Home Assistant's sidebar
> requires `data-panel-id` clicks — using `page.goto('/config/integrations')`
> causes auth failures and TimeoutErrors because HA does not support deep linking
> without an established session.

## Done When

- [ ] `appUrl` resolved into `RESOLVED_APP_URL` (applying all 5 sources)
- [ ] `seedCommand` resolved into `RESOLVED_SEED_COMMAND` (env var or local.md)
- [ ] Connectivity check passed (APP_REACHABLE) using `$RESOLVED_APP_URL`
- [ ] Seed command ran and succeeded — or skipped (not configured / production)
- [ ] **`moduleType` detected** from `package.json` (`"module"` or `"commonjs"`) and written to `.ralph-state.json → playwrightEnv.moduleType`
- [ ] **Module type documented in `.progress.md`** under `### Module System` — enables subsequent tasks to reuse without re-detecting
- [ ] `playwrightEnv` written to `.ralph-state.json` (non-secret fields only, including `resolvedAt`)
- [ ] `resolvedAt` freshness verified when source 3 (state cache) was used — stale
  values (>2 hours) must trigger re-resolution from sources 1–2, not silent reuse
- [ ] `authMode` resolved
- [ ] `isolated` setting resolved and written to state
- [ ] `tokenBootstrapRule` documented in `playwright-env.local.md` if `authMode=token`
- [ ] `tokenLocalStorageKey` documented in `playwright-env.local.md` if `tokenBootstrapRule=localStorage`
- [ ] Secret env vars referenced, not stored
- [ ] `allowWrite` posture confirmed
- [ ] Domain-specific selector map skill identified and noted for loading
- [ ] Missing critical context results in `ESCALATE`, not improvisation
