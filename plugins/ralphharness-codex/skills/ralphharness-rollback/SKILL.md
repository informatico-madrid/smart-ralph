# Ralph Specum Checkpoint Rollback

You are rolling back the working tree to the pre-execution git checkpoint stored in the spec's state file.

## Contract

- Resolve the target by explicit path, exact name, or `.current-spec`
- Read the spec's `.ralph-state.json` to find the git checkpoint SHA
- Use Bash to restore to that SHA
- Clean up any remaining state files after rollback

## Usage

```
$ralphharness-rollback [spec-name-or-path]
```
