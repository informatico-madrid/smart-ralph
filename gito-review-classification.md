## CONFIRMED NO-FIX — 34 Issues

### Intentional Design (15)

| # | File | Reason |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | .gitignore | Self-referencing is intentional (prevent .gitignore in commits) |
| 2 | .gitignore | _bmad-output/ exclusion is intentional (review artifacts) |
| 3 | _bmad/ | CSV data typos — config data, not executable code |
| 4 | _bmad/ | CSV data grammar — non-code content |
| 5 | _bmad/ | CSV data naming — config data, cosmetic |
| 6 | _bmad/ | CSV data duplicates — config data |
| 7 | _bmad/ | CSV data missing entries — config completeness, not code bug |
| 8 | _bmad/ | TOML data comments — documentation note, not code |
| 9 | _bmad/ | TOML data version numbers — metadata, not code |
| 10 | _bmad/ | TOML data descriptions — documentation |
| 12 | _bmad/custom/config.user.toml | User config file — personal preferences |
| 30 | plugins/ralph-specum/commands/implement.md | Dead code — already verified as fixed |
| 31 | plugins/ralph-specum/commands/implement.md | Dead code — already verified as fixed |
| 34 | plugins/ralph-specum/hooks/ | Non-critical suggestion — not a bug |
| 35 | plugins/ralph-specum/hooks/ | Non-critical suggestion — not a bug |

### Cosmetic / Style (19)

| # | File | Reason |
|---|------|--------|
| 13 | docs/ARCHITECTURE.md | Heading hierarchy — subjective style preference |
| 14 | docs/README.md | Grammar — documentation only |
| 17 | plans/*.md | Typos — documentation only |
| 28 | plugins/ralph-specum/hooks/ | Code style — subjective formatting |
| 39 | plugins/ralph-specum/references/loop-safety.md | Numbering 6.5 → renumber — subjective preference |
| 41 | plugins/ralph-specum/references/role-contracts.md | Inconsistent naming (.md vs agent) — cosmetic |
| 44 | plugins/ralph-specum/references/role-contracts.md | Misplaced note — documentation organization |
| 45 | plugins/ralph-specum/references/role-contracts.md | Inconsistent phrasing — documentation style |
| 47 | plugins/ralph-specum/schemas/spec.schema.json | Missing format: date-time — nice-to-have, not required |
| 51 | specs/bmad-bridge-plugin/.progress.md | Missing code formatting — documentation readability |
| 52 | specs/bmad-bridge-plugin/.progress.md | Referenced task doesn't exist — progress doc artifact |
| 55 | specs/bmad-bridge-plugin/design.md | FALSE POSITIVE: /ralph-specum:implement IS the correct command |
| 57 | specs/bmad-bridge-plugin/plan.md | Spec title uses common abbreviation — naming convention |
| 59 | specs/bmad-bridge-plugin/requirements.md | FALSE POSITIVE: "product manager" is correctly spelled |
| 64 | specs/loop-safety-infra/.research-codebase.md | State field naming — research doc example, not code |
| 68 | specs/loop-safety-infra/requirements.md | CI snapshot null handling — documentation clarification |
| 88 | specs/role-boundaries/final-spec-adversarial-review.md | Mixed Spanish/English — adversarial review document language |
| 89 | specs/role-boundaries/requirements.md | FALSE POSITIVE: [ralph-specum] IS the plugin name |
| 90 | specs/role-boundaries/requirements.md | Terminology "section boundaries" — subjective |

## INVESTIGATION RESULTS

### #81 — grep -c \|\| echo 0 in test-integration.sh
**Verdict: CONFIRMED FIX**
**Reason:** Under `set -euo pipefail`, `grep -c` outputs "0" and exits 1 when no matches found. `|| echo 0` appends another "0", making the variable "0\n0". Arithmetic comparison `[ "$var" -gt 0 ]` fails with "integer expression expected". Fix: change `|| echo 0` to `|| true`.

### #82 — State file overwritten in test-integration.sh
**Verdict: CONFIRMED FIX**
**Reason:** Lines 60-71 create circuit breaker state. Line 73 `echo '{}' > "$tmp/.ralph-state.json"` immediately overwrites it. Test 5 reads empty state instead of configured circuit breaker state.

### #42 — Writes column has reads description
**Verdict: CONFIRMED FIX** — Wrong semantic content. Should be `_(read-only)_`.

### #43 — Contradictory denylist "All files"
**Verdict: CONFIRMED FIX** — Direct contradiction. Should be `_(read-only)_`.
