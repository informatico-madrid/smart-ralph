# Tasks: collaboration-resolution

## Phase 1: Make It Work (POC)

Focus: Create the new reference file, make key additive changes that prove the collaboration pattern works. Accept hardcoded values. Skip tests.

### POC Core — Create deliverables

- [x] 1.1 Create `references/collaboration-resolution.md` — Cross-branch regression investigation workflow block
  - **Do**:
    1. Create `plugins/ralphharness/references/collaboration-resolution.md`
    2. Add workflow block "Cross-branch regression investigation" with:
       - Entry condition: test green on `main`, red on `HEAD`, neither test nor fixture changed
       - Steps: (a) run `git diff main...HEAD` on failing code path, (b) identify semantic change, (c) propose fix, (d) run test to verify
       - Exit condition: test green or escalation
       - Explicit statement that trigger surface is ANY regression (including non-E2E unit-test)
    3. Verify file exists and contains required patterns
  - **Files**: `plugins/ralphharness/references/collaboration-resolution.md` (new)
  - **Done when**: File exists with the named workflow block, entry condition, 4 steps, exit condition, and ANY-regression statement
  - **Verify**: `grep -q "Cross-branch regression investigation" plugins/ralphharness/references/collaboration-resolution.md && grep -q "git diff main...HEAD" plugins/ralphharness/references/collaboration-resolution.md && grep -qi "any.*regression\|non-E2E" plugins/ralphharness/references/collaboration-resolution.md && echo 1.1_PASS`

    1. Read `plugins/ralphharness/templates/chat.md` to find the end of the Collaboration markers table
    2. Append 3 rows:
       - `HYPOTHESIS` — Proposed root-cause theory for a regression (typically reviewer)
       - `EXPERIMENT` — A test/probe run to validate a hypothesis (typically executor)

    2. Append depth/limit rule: the new trigger runs existing "Check Fix Task Limits" and "Check Fix Task Depth" steps unchanged; on limit/depth exceeded, no fix task generated and existing block/escalate handling applies
  - **Files**: `plugins/ralphharness/references/failure-recovery.md`
  - **Done when**: Dedup rule and depth/limit rule documented in BUG_DISCOVERY section
  - **Verify**: `grep -q "resolved_at.*already-handled\|already-handled.*resolved_at" plugins/ralphharness/references/failure-recovery.md && grep -q "Check Fix Task Limits" plugins/ralphharness/references/failure-recovery.md && grep -q "Check Fix Task Depth" plugins/ralphharness/references/failure-recovery.md && echo 1.6_PASS`

       - If all 3 hold → backend/environmental regression → MUST NOT modify the test
       - Ambiguous case: any condition ambiguous → treat as NOT satisfied, record via `chat.md` FINDING marker
    3. Verify no existing section removed
  - **Files**: `plugins/ralphharness/agents/external-reviewer.md`
  - **Done when**: Baseline-check rule (3 conditions + ambiguous case) present; additive only

## Phase 3: Testing

Focus: Add comprehensive test coverage. One RED/GREEN pair per Test Coverage Table row. Integration tests exercise BUG_DISCOVERY behavioral assertions in a real temp workspace (`mktemp -d`) — not a mock. The simulation mechanism in each integration GREEN task: implement a bash function inline in the bats test that reads `task_review.md` and `fixTaskMap` from a temp workspace, performs the coordinator's Pre-Delegation Check logic (check `fixTaskMap` for dedup matching `criterion_failed` + `evidence`, check depth/limit via `fixTaskMap[task_id].attempts >= maxFixTasksPerOriginal`), and appends a `X.Y.N [FIX X.Y]` line to tasks.md if allowed.

## Phase 5: PR Lifecycle

Goal: Autonomous PR management loop until all criteria met.

- [ ] 5.1 Monitor PR CI status
  - **Do**: Check PR CI status. If green, proceed to 5.2. If any check fails, read failure details, fix issues, push fixes, re-check.
  - **Verify**: `gh pr checks` shows all passing
  - **Files**: None (PR monitoring only)
  - **Done when**: All CI checks green
  - **Commit**: `fix(harness): address CI failures` (only if fixes needed)
  - _Requirements: Phase 5 completion_

    1. `git diff main...HEAD --stat` to confirm only expected files changed
    2. `bats tests/collaboration-resolution.bats` — all tests pass
    3. Verify modularity: `collaboration-resolution.md` is a standalone reference; changes to other files are additive and self-contained

  - **Done when**: PR is clean, tests pass, changes are modular
  - **Commit**: None
  - _Requirements: Phase 5 completion_
  - _Design: All components_

## Notes

- POC shortcuts: Phase 1 skips tests, accepts hardcoded values. Integration tests (Phase 3) use simulated coordinator behavior in bats — the actual coordinator loop is not modified (NFR-2).
- Production TODOs: The BUG_DISCOVERY trigger and dedup logic are documented in markdown; the actual implementation is in the coordinator (separate concern, not modified by this spec).
- All changes are additive — zero sections removed or rewritten (NFR-1).
- `signals.jsonl` and its schema are NOT modified (NFR-5).
- The 6 new signals are collaboration markers in `chat.md`, NOT control signals.
- No new infrastructure introduced: no new agents, scripts, loops, or channels.
