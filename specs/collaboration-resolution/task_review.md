### [task-1.10] Reconcile channel-map.md — add spec-executor as chat.md writer
- status: FAIL
- severity: major
- reviewed_at: 2026-05-15T20:19:52Z
- criterion_failed: premature-task-completion — task 1.10 not marked [x] but verify fails
- evidence: |
  $ grep "chat.md" plugins/ralphharness/references/channel-map.md | head -1 | grep -q "spec-executor" && echo 1.10_PASS || echo 1.10_FAIL
  1.10_FAIL

  channel-map.md Writer(s) cell still shows "coordinator, reviewer" — spec-executor NOT added.
  Task 1.10 is marked [ ] in tasks.md (not yet started).
- fix_hint: Add spec-executor to the Writer(s) cell for chat.md row in channel-map.md.
  Change "coordinator, reviewer" to "coordinator, reviewer, spec-executor".
  This is the same fix as described in FR-13b.
