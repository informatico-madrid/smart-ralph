- Phase 4 (Quality Gates): 6 tasks
- Phase 5 (PR Lifecycle): 3 tasks

**Total**: 55 tasks

## Phase 1: Make It Work (POC)

Focus: Implement the mechanical trigger, role files, placement step, and all append-only edits. Accept hardcoded values; polish in Phase 2.

- [x] 1.1 [P] Create test directory structure
  - **Do**: Create `plugins/ralphharness/tests/` and `plugins/ralphharness/tests/fixtures/` directories.
  - **Files**: `plugins/ralphharness/tests/`, `plugins/ralphharness/tests/fixtures/`
  - **Done when**: Both directories exist.
  - **Verify**: `test -d plugins/ralphharness/tests && test -d plugins/ralphharness/tests/fixtures && echo P1.1_PASS`
  - **Commit**: `chore(pair-debug): create test directory structure`
  - _Design: Test Infrastructure (step 1)_

- [x] 1.2 [P] Document bats run command in progress.md
  - **Do**: Append a "Testing" subsection to `.progress.md` documenting that tests run via `bats plugins/ralphharness/tests/`, bats 1.13.0 is on PATH, no npm test script exists.
  - **Files**: `specs/pair-debug-auto-trigger/.progress.md`
  - **Done when**: `.progress.md` contains the bats command documentation.
  - **Verify**: `grep -q 'bats plugins/ralphharness/tests/' specs/pair-debug-auto-trigger/.progress.md && echo P1.2_PASS`
  - **Commit**: `docs(pair-debug): document bats test command in progress`
  - _Requirements: Verification Contract_
  - _Design: Test Strategy_

- [x] 1.3 [P] Create `references/pair-debug.md`
  - **Do**: Create the file with the following sections:
    1. `## Section 1 — 3-Condition Auto-Trigger` — Document all 3 conditions (a/b/c) canonically. Include the reconciliation sentence: "The roadmap states 3 conditions; plan.md listed 4 by splitting condition (a) into two parts. The canonical count is 3: (a) pre-existing test failing + test file unchanged, (b) taskIteration >= 2, (c) no reviewer FAIL row. ALL THREE must hold."
    2. `## Section 2 — Driver / Navigator Roles` — Table with: Driver = spec-executor (writes code, runs commands, applies fixes, adds debug logging); Navigator = external-reviewer (reads diff, analyzes architecture, proposes hypotheses, suggests experiments, validates findings). Include shared instruction: "formulate hypotheses, respond to the other's, do not escalate to a human unless an explicit product/design decision is required."
    3. `## Section 3 — Anti-Anchoring Rule` — (i) Navigator MUST propose >=2 independent hypotheses BEFORE the pair commits to investigating one; (ii) a hypothesis becomes ROOT_CAUSE only after an EXPERIMENT produced direct evidence, not reasoning alone; (iii) reuse collaboration-resolution.md's >10-cycle escalation bound as the stalled-loop exit.
    4. `## Section 4 — Two-Instance / Filesystem-Coordination` — Statement that Driver and Navigator run as two separate instances coordinating ONLY through the shared filesystem (chat.md, signals.jsonl, .ralph-state.json), no in-memory handoff, no Task-tool call.
    5. `## Section 5 — Runtime-to-Destination-Path Map` — Table: Roo Code → `.roo/commands/pair-debug-{driver,navigator}.md`, Qwen → `.qwen/commands/`, Cursor → `.cursor/commands/`, other/unknown → manual fallback.
    6. `## Section 6 — Loop Body Reference` — One-line pointer to `collaboration-resolution.md` for the HYPOTHESIS→EXPERIMENT→FINDING→ROOT_CAUSE→FIX_PROPOSAL loop body. Do NOT re-document the loop.
    7. `## Section 7 — Example Flow` — One concrete example: trigger fires → chat.md announcement → Navigator writes HYPOTHESIS → Driver runs EXPERIMENT → both write FINDING → ROOT_CAUSE → Driver implements FIX_PROPOSAL → verification passes → grep-clean PAIR-DEBUG: logs.
  - **Files**: `plugins/ralphharness/references/pair-debug.md`
  - **Done when**: File exists with all 7 sections; contains the 3-condition trigger, role table, anti-anchoring rule, filesystem-coordination statement, runtime→path map, loop reference, and example flow.
  - **Verify**: `test -f plugins/ralphharness/references/pair-debug.md && grep -q '3-Condition' plugins/ralphharness/references/pair-debug.md && grep -q 'Anti-Anchoring' plugins/ralphharness/references/pair-debug.md && grep -q 'Runtime-to-Destination-Path' plugins/ralphharness/references/pair-debug.md && echo P1.3_PASS`
  - **Commit**: `feat(pair-debug): create pair-debug.md with trigger, roles, anti-anchoring, path map`
  - _Requirements: FR-1, FR-2, FR-3, FR-4, FR-5, FR-6, FR-7_
  - _Design: Component 1, Component 2, Component 5_

- [x] 1.4 [P] Update collaboration-resolution.md cycle bound
  - **Do**: Verify line 53 reads `more than 10 times` (already applied in requirements phase). If it still reads `more than 3 times`, change to `more than 10 times`. Document the verification in this task's commit.
  - **Files**: `plugins/ralphharness/references/collaboration-resolution.md`
  - **Done when**: Line 53 reads `more than 10 times`.
  - **Verify**: `sed -n '53p' plugins/ralphharness/references/collaboration-resolution.md | grep -q 'more than 10 times' && echo P1.4_PASS`
  - **Commit**: `fix(pair-debug): confirm collaboration-resolution.md cycle bound is 10`
  - _Requirements: FR-13, AC-4.3_
  - _Design: Component 1, File Structure_

- [x] 1.5 [P] Create `agents/pair-debug-driver.md`
  - **Do**: Create the role file with the following structure:
    1. **Section 0 — Bootstrap (Self-Start)** — Modeled on `external-reviewer.md` Section 0: read `specs/.current-spec` → specName, set basePath, read `.ralph-state.json` → confirm phase is execution, check for DEADLOCK in `signals.jsonl` (stop if found), update `chat.executor.lastReadLine`, announce "Driver ready. Spec: <specName>.", begin experiment loop.
    2. **Section 1 — Identity** — Name: pair-debug-driver, Role: Driver = spec-executor in pair-debug mode (writes code, runs commands, applies fixes, adds PAIR-DEBUG:-tagged debug logging, runs experiments).
    3. **Section 2 — Filesystem-Coordination Protocol** — Read chat.md every ~30s tracking lastReadLine. Inlined atomic-append block for chat.md (fd 200 flock): `(exec 200>"${basePath}/chat.md.lock"; flock -x -w 5 200 || timeout; printf '%s\n' "$msg" >> "${basePath}/chat.md") 200>"${basePath}/chat.md.lock"`. Inlined atomic-append block for signals.jsonl (fd 202 flock, same pattern). Never assume Navigator shares this process.
    4. **Section 3 — Experiment Loop** — Read Navigator's HYPOTHESIS signals. For each, instrument code with PAIR-DEBUG:-tagged log capturing suspect variable + hypothesis under test. Run minimal experiment (one variable at a time). Append EXPERIMENT then FINDING to chat.md. On agreed ROOT_CAUSE, implement the FIX_PROPOSAL, verify the failing test passes.
    5. **Section 4 — Debug-Logging Rules** — Every temporary log carries the PAIR-DEBUG: marker. `grep -rn 'PAIR-DEBUG:' <changed files>` MUST return empty before TASK_COMPLETE. Logs capture the suspect variable/code path and the hypothesis being tested (decision-path capture), not just "got here".
    6. **Section 5 — Exit Conditions** — SUCCESS: ROOT_CAUSE confirmed + fix verified + grep-clean. LOOP_BOUND: >10 hypothesis cycles → DEADLOCK to signals.jsonl. HARD LIMIT: taskIteration >= maxTaskIterations → escalate to human. Never runs unbounded.
    7. **Section 6 — References (self-contained)** — Points to `references/pair-debug.md` and `references/collaboration-resolution.md` AND inlines the one-paragraph loop summary and the >10-cycle bound (so a foreign runtime with no plugin can still operate).
  - **Files**: `plugins/ralphharness/agents/pair-debug-driver.md`
  - **Done when**: File exists with Sections 0–6. Section 0 present (self-discovery pattern). PAIR-DEBUG: rule present. grep-cleanup step present. >10-cycle exit present. No `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`-only dependency that is not also inlined.
  - **Verify**: `test -f plugins/ralphharness/agents/pair-debug-driver.md && grep -q 'Section 0' plugins/ralphharness/agents/pair-debug-driver.md && grep -q 'PAIR-DEBUG:' plugins/ralphharness/agents/pair-debug-driver.md && grep -q '10' plugins/ralphharness/agents/pair-debug-driver.md && echo P1.5_PASS`
  - **Commit**: `feat(pair-debug): create pair-debug-driver.md role file with Section 0 Bootstrap`
  - _Requirements: FR-14, FR-15, AC-6.2, AC-6.3_
  - _Design: Component 2_

- [ ] 1.6 [P] Create `agents/pair-debug-navigator.md`
  - **Do**: Create the role file with the following structure:
    1. **Section 0 — Bootstrap (Self-Start)** — Identical pattern to Driver: self-discover specName/basePath, confirm phase: execution, read tasks.md + task_review.md + chat.md, honor DEADLOCK, update `chat.reviewer.lastReadLine`, announce, begin hypothesis loop.
    2. **Section 1 — Identity** — Name: pair-debug-navigator, Role: Navigator = external-reviewer in pair-debug mode (reads diff, analyzes architecture, proposes hypotheses, suggests experiments, validates findings). **Never edits implementation files or `.ralph-state.json`** (Spec 3 boundary inlined verbatim: ".ralph-state.json — except: chat.reviewer.lastReadLine").
    3. **Section 2 — Filesystem-Coordination Protocol** — Same fd-200 / fd-202 flock blocks as the Driver, inlined verbatim.
    4. **Section 3 — Hypothesis Loop with Anti-Anchoring** — Critical ordering: Navigator MUST write >=2 independent HYPOTHESIS signals BEFORE seeing Driver's first EXPERIMENT. A hypothesis is promoted to ROOT_CAUSE only after an EXPERIMENT produced direct evidence, not reasoning alone. Analyze each FINDING, propose next narrowing experiment, on convergence write ROOT_CAUSE + FIX_PROPOSAL.
    5. **Section 4 — Exit Conditions** — SUCCESS: ROOT_CAUSE confirmed, Driver implements the fix. LOOP_BOUND: >10 cycles → DEADLOCK. SILENCE: no new chat.md entries for 3 cycles → DEADLOCK. Navigator never proposes a fix as a file edit — only as a FIX_PROPOSAL signal.
    6. **Section 5 — References (self-contained)** — Same self-containment as Driver: inlines loop summary and >10-cycle bound.
  - **Files**: `plugins/ralphharness/agents/pair-debug-navigator.md`
  - **Done when**: File exists with Sections 0–5. Section 0 present. >=2-hypotheses anti-anchoring rule present (explicitly referencing "BEFORE the first EXPERIMENT"). Never-edit-implementation boundary present. No plugin-only path.
  - **Verify**: `test -f plugins/ralphharness/agents/pair-debug-navigator.md && grep -q 'Section 0' plugins/ralphharness/agents/pair-debug-navigator.md && grep -qi '2.*independent.*hypothesis' plugins/ralphharness/agents/pair-debug-navigator.md && grep -qi 'implementation' plugins/ralphharness/agents/pair-debug-navigator.md && echo P1.6_PASS`
  - **Commit**: `feat(pair-debug): create pair-debug-navigator.md role file with anti-anchoring`
  - _Requirements: FR-14, FR-15, AC-6.2, AC-6.3_
  - _Design: Component 3_

- [ ] 1.7 [P] Append Pair-Debug Mode Entry Point to failure-recovery.md
  - **Do**: Append a new section after "Max Retries (Non-Recovery Mode)" (after line 84) titled "## Pair-Debug Mode Entry Point". Content:
    1. Entry trigger: When `taskIteration >= 2` AND all 3 conditions hold (per `references/pair-debug.md` Section 1), BEFORE generating the fix task:
       - Condition (a): Pre-existing test failing, test file unchanged this spec — run `git diff $TASK_START_SHA..HEAD -- <failing-test-file>`; returns empty = unchanged.
       - Condition (b): `taskIteration >= 2` — read via `jq '.taskIteration' "$SPEC_PATH/.ralph-state.json"`.
       - Condition (c): No reviewer FAIL row — `task_review.md` contains no `status: FAIL` entry for current `taskIndex` (reuses existing FAIL-row parse from coordinator-pattern.md §127).
    2. If ALL 3 conditions hold → append `### PAIR-DEBUG MODE ACTIVATED` to chat.md via the existing atomic-append block (fd 200). This replaces the normal delegation announcement for that one task only.
    3. If ANY condition is false → normal fix-task path runs, byte-identical to pre-spec.
    4. The check runs exactly once, at entry, before the announcement.
    5. Pointer to `references/pair-debug.md` for full trigger documentation.
  - **Files**: `plugins/ralphharness/references/failure-recovery.md`
  - **Done when**: New section exists after Max Retries (Non-Recovery Mode). Contains the 3-condition check, the chat.md announcement step, and the pointer to pair-debug.md. Existing Max Retries / Recovery Mode / BUG_DISCOVERY sections unchanged.
  - **Verify**: `grep -q 'Pair-Debug Mode Entry Point' plugins/ralphharness/references/failure-recovery.md && grep -q 'PAIR-DEBUG MODE ACTIVATED' plugins/ralphharness/references/failure-recovery.md && echo P1.7_PASS`
  - **Commit**: `feat(pair-debug): append Pair-Debug Mode Entry Point to failure-recovery.md`
  - _Requirements: FR-8, FR-2, FR-3, FR-4, FR-5, AC-1.1, AC-1.2_
  - _Design: Component 1, Step 2_

- [ ] 1.8 [P] Append Pair-Debug Mode Announcement to coordinator-pattern.md
  - **Do**: Append a new section after the "Signal Protocol" section (after line ~202, before "Chat Protocol"). Title: "## Pair-Debug Mode Announcement". Content:
    1. Document the `### PAIR-DEBUG MODE ACTIVATED` chat.md message format.
    2. Message template:
       ```
       ### PAIR-DEBUG MODE ACTIVATED
       Driver: spec-executor | Navigator: external-reviewer
       Trigger: [a] pre-existing test failing + test file unchanged | [b] taskIteration >= 2 | [c] no reviewer FAIL row
       Instruction: Both agents adopt Driver/Navigator roles. Navigator proposes hypotheses, Driver runs experiments. Exchange HYPOTHESIS/EXPERIMENT/FINDING signals per references/collaboration-resolution.md. Do not escalate to human unless a product/design decision is required.
       ```
    3. State that this message **replaces the normal delegation announcement for that one task only**.
    4. Reuses the existing atomic-append block (fd 200, chat.md) — same pattern as the control-signal append block.
  - **Files**: `plugins/ralphharness/references/coordinator-pattern.md`
  - **Done when**: New section exists after Signal Protocol. Contains the message template, Driver/Navigator naming, trigger summary, instruction, and replacement-note. Existing Signal Protocol / Chat Protocol sections unchanged.
  - **Verify**: `grep -q 'Pair-Debug Mode Announcement' plugins/ralphharness/references/coordinator-pattern.md && grep -q 'PAIR-DEBUG MODE ACTIVATED' plugins/ralphharness/references/coordinator-pattern.md && echo P1.8_PASS`
  - **Commit**: `feat(pair-debug): append Pair-Debug Mode Announcement to coordinator-pattern.md`
  - _Requirements: FR-10, AC-2.2, AC-5.1_
  - _Design: Component 1, Step 3_

- [ ] 1.9 Append Debug Logging section to spec-executor.md
  - **Do**: Append a new section after `</rules>` (after line ~397) titled "## Debug Logging in Pair-Debug Mode". Content:
    1. "In pair-debug mode, temporary `_LOGGER.warning()` / `console.log()` statements MAY be added as an investigation technique."
    2. "Every temporary log MUST carry a consistent `PAIR-DEBUG:` marker in its message and record the suspect variable/code path and the hypothesis it tests (decision-path capture), not a bare 'got here'."
    3. "Before emitting `TASK_COMPLETE`, remove or convert-to-test all `PAIR-DEBUG:`-tagged logs. Verifiable: `grep -rn 'PAIR-DEBUG:' <changed implementation files>` MUST return empty. If non-empty, TASK_COMPLETE is withheld."
  - **Files**: `plugins/ralphharness/agents/spec-executor.md`
  - **Done when**: New section exists after `</rules>`. Contains the 3 rules: temporary logs allowed, PAIR-DEBUG: marker + decision-path capture, mandatory grep cleanup before TASK_COMPLETE. `<role>` and Role Boundaries sections unchanged.
  - **Verify**: `grep -q 'Debug Logging in Pair-Debug Mode' plugins/ralphharness/agents/spec-executor.md && grep -q 'PAIR-DEBUG:' plugins/ralphharness/agents/spec-executor.md && grep -q 'TASK_COMPLETE' plugins/ralphharness/agents/spec-executor.md && echo P1.9_PASS`
  - **Commit**: `feat(pair-debug): append debug-logging section to spec-executor.md`
  - _Requirements: FR-9, AC-3.1, AC-3.2, AC-3.3_
  - _Design: Component 2 (Step 4), Test Coverage Table row "Debug-log cleanup"_

- [ ] 1.10 Append Pair-Debug Placement Step to implement.md
  - **Do**: Append a new sub-section after "Parallel Reviewer Onboarding" (after the "**If user answers NO:** continue normal flow..." line) and before "---\n\nAfter writing the state file..." (before the "---" separator). Title: "### Pair-Debug Placement Step". Content:
    1. Dialog (asked alongside the parallel-reviewer question):
       ```
       Where should the pair-debug Driver/Navigator roles run if pair-debug mode triggers?
       (a) This same instance — roles run in-session [DEFAULT]
       (b) A second Claude Code instance
       (c) A foreign agent runtime (Roo Code, Qwen, Cursor, other)
       ```
    2. **(a) chosen** → no files copied, no further questions; pair-debug runs in-session. Export step skipped silently. Behavior byte-identical to pre-spec.
    3. **(b) chosen** → manual print: absolute paths of `pair-debug-driver.md` and `pair-debug-navigator.md`, plus the activation step "open a second Claude Code session in this repo and paste the file contents as the session prompt."
    4. **(c) chosen** → **which-runtime sub-question** (Roo Code / Qwen / Cursor / other), then **export-mode question** (automatic copy / manual print).
       - **Automatic copy**: resolve destination path from the runtime→path map (per pair-debug.md Section 5). If destination already exists, prompt overwrite/skip per file. Copy both role files. Print the report.
       - **Manual print**: print the absolute source path of each role file AND the copy-paste-ready activation text. Print the report.
       - **Unknown runtime**: fall back to manual print with reason ("no known destination path for <runtime>").
    5. **Export report** (printed in BOTH modes):
       ```
       Pair-debug roles exported.
       Driver role file:
         source:      <abs>/plugins/ralphharness/agents/pair-debug-driver.md
         destination: <abs dest> # automatic mode only
       Navigator role file:
         source:      <abs>/plugins/ralphharness/agents/pair-debug-navigator.md
         destination: <abs dest> # automatic mode only
       To activate:
         <runtime-specific concrete step>
       ```
    6. **Idempotency**: if re-running and destination files already exist, prompt overwrite/skip rather than failing or silently clobbering.
  - **Files**: `plugins/ralphharness/commands/implement.md`
  - **Done when**: New sub-section exists after Parallel Reviewer Onboarding. Contains the where-to-run dialog, all 3 branches (a/b/c), export modes (automatic copy + manual print), runtime→path map reference, overwrite/skip idempotency, and the export report with absolute paths. No existing content removed.
  - **Verify**: `grep -q 'Pair-Debug Placement Step' plugins/ralphharness/commands/implement.md && grep -q 'Where should the pair-debug' plugins/ralphharness/commands/implement.md && grep -q 'overwrite' plugins/ralphharness/commands/implement.md && echo P1.10_PASS`

  - _Design: Component 4, Component 5_

- [ ] 1.11 [P] Create trigger bats test
  - **Do**: Create `plugins/ralphharness/tests/test-pair-debug-trigger.bats` with test cases for the trigger checker:
    1. `trigger-all-true` — Stub inputs: `taskIteration=2`, `git diff` returns empty (test unchanged), no FAIL row → expect "activate".
    2. `trigger-taskIteration-1` — `taskIteration=1` → expect "do not activate" (condition b false).
    3. `trigger-fail-row-present` — FAIL row exists for taskIndex → expect "do not activate" (condition c false).
    4. `trigger-test-file-changed` — Stub inputs for a real temp git repo where tests/ changed → expect "do not activate" (condition a false).

  - **Done when**: All final checks pass.
  - **Commit**: `chore(pair-debug): final verification — all components confirmed`

## Notes

- **POC shortcuts taken**: The trigger logic is documented in prompt text (failure-recovery.md); no standalone trigger script is created. The coordinator evaluates the 3 conditions mechanically per the prompt instructions. Role files are prompt markdown — verified structurally (grep), not behaviorally at unit level.
- **Production TODOs**: The trigger implementation in failure-recovery.md should be tested with a real spec execution once the plugin ships. The export mechanism for foreign runtimes should be validated with actual Roo Code / Qwen instances.
- **Test infrastructure**: `bats` on PATH. Run all tests with `bats plugins/ralphharness/tests/`. No existing test runner config — bats files are standalone.
- **E2E testing**: For behavioral verification of pair-debug mode, a real spec execution with a deliberately failing pre-existing test is required. The trigger-repo fixture (3.7) supports this.
