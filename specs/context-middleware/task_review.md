<!-- reviewer-config
principles: [SOLID, DRY, FAIL_FAST]
codebase-conventions: shell scripts use set -euo pipefail, bats for testing, jq for JSON, flock for locking, atomic writes via temp+mv, single-responsibility functions, error logging to stderr, degradation on failure

# Task Review Log

<!-- 
Workflow: External reviewer agent writes review entries to this file after completing tasks.
Status values: FAIL, WARNING, PASS, PENDING
- FAIL: Task failed reviewer's criteria - requires fix
- WARNING: Task passed but with concerns - note in .progress.md
- PASS: Task passed external review - mark complete
- PENDING: reviewer is working on it, spec-executor should not re-mark this task until status changes. spec-executor: skip this task and move to the next unchecked one.
-->

## Reviews

<!-- 
Review entry template:
- status: FAIL | WARNING | PASS | PENDING
- severity: critical | major | minor (optional)
- reviewed_at: ISO timestamp
- criterion_failed: Which requirement/criterion failed (for FAIL status)
- evidence: Brief description of what was observed
- fix_hint: Suggested fix or direction (for FAIL/WARNING)
- resolved_at: ISO timestamp (only for resolved entries)
