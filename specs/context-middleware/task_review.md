<!-- reviewer-config
principles: [SOLID, DRY, FAIL_FAST]
codebase-conventions: shell scripts use set -euo pipefail, bats for testing, jq for JSON, flock for locking, atomic writes via temp+mv, single-responsibility functions, error logging to stderr, degradation on failure

# Task Review Log

<!-- 
Workflow: External reviewer agent writes review entries to this file after completing tasks.
Status values: FAIL, WARNING, PASS, PENDING
- FAIL: Task failed reviewer's criteria - requires fix
- WARNING: Task passed but with concerns - note in .progress.md
- PASS: Task passed external review - mark complete
- PENDING: reviewer is working on it, spec-executor should not re-mark this task until status changes. spec-executor: skip this task and move to the next unchecked one.
-->

## Reviews

<!-- 
Review entry template:
- status: FAIL | WARNING | PASS | PENDING
- severity: critical | major | minor (optional)
- reviewed_at: ISO timestamp
- criterion_failed: Which requirement/criterion failed (for FAIL status)
- evidence: Brief description of what was observed
- fix_hint: Suggested fix or direction (for FAIL/WARNING)
- resolved_at: ISO timestamp (only for resolved entries)

| PASS | none | 2026-05-17T03:55:00Z | 1.1 | none | All 5 functions defined, sourced correctly, fd 201 used for metrics lock. Verify: `bash -n lib-context.sh && echo 1.1_PASS` → 1.1_PASS. Syntax clean. | N/A | 2026-05-17T03:55:00Z |
| PASS | none | 2026-05-17T04:02:00Z | 1.2 | none | executionPhase enum has 4 values (poc, refactor, test, quality). chat.properties has 3 entries (coordinator, executor, reviewer). Both verify commands pass. | N/A | 2026-05-17T04:02:00Z |
| WARNING | critical | 2026-05-17T04:24:00Z | 1.3 | anti-stuck intervention — 6 cycles no progress | No implementation output for 6 consecutive review cycles. taskIndex=2, globalIteration=3, but no scripts created (condense-context.sh missing), no executor messages in chat.md, no signals. | Executor may be reading design docs extensively or stuck. If no progress in 2 more cycles, escalate to FAIL. | |
| FAIL | critical | 2026-05-17T04:28:00Z | 1.3 | progress-stuck — 7 cycles no output after WARNING | Second cycle after WARNING: no new scripts, no executor messages, no commits. Escalated from WARNING. | Executor stalled. Consider manual intervention or restart. | 2026-05-17T07:52:00Z |
| PASS | none | 2026-05-17T07:56:00Z | 1.3 | none | condense-context.sh (255 lines) implements: arg parsing, degradation check, archive, gate. Verify: `bash -n condense-context.sh && echo 1.3_PASS` → 1.3_PASS. Syntax clean. | N/A | 2026-05-17T07:56:00Z |

Verify: `bash -n condense-context.sh && echo 1.5_PASS` → 1.5_PASS. Syntax clean. | N/A | 2026-05-17T07:56:00Z |
| PASS | none | 2026-05-17T04:02:00Z | 1.2 | none | executionPhase enum added (poc|refactor|test|quality); chat properties extended with coordinator and reviewer lastReadLine alongside existing executor. Verify: both jq queries return correct values. | N/A | 2026-05-17T04:02:00Z |
