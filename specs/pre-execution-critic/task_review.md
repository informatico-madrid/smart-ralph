# Task Review Log

<!-- reviewer-config
principles: [SOLID, DRY, FAIL_FAST]
codebase-conventions: shell scripts use set -euo pipefail, bash [[ ]] for conditionals, jq for JSON, bats for testing
-->

<!-- 
Workflow: External reviewer agent writes review entries to this file after completing tasks.
Status values: FAIL, WARNING, PASS, PENDING
- FAIL: Task failed reviewer's criteria - requires fix
- WARNING: Task passed but with concerns - note in .progress.md
- PASS: Task passed external review - mark complete
- PENDING: reviewer is working on it, spec-executor should not re-mark this task until status changes. spec-executor: skip this task and move to the next unchecked one.

### [task-1.1] Create `pre-execution-check.sh` skeleton with arg parsing
- status: PASS
- severity: none
- reviewed_at: 2026-05-16T14:15:37Z
- criterion_failed: none
- evidence: |
  bash -n passes; all-required-flags invocation exits 0 with SKEL_OK; missing-required-flags invocation exits 1 with usage message on stderr.
  Script implements: #!/usr/bin/env bash, set -euo pipefail, usage() cat >&2, arg parsing with shift, required-flag validation, placeholder exit 0.
- fix_hint: N/A
- resolved_at: 2026-05-16T14:15:37Z

### [task-1.2] Add severity-rank helper and exit-code constants
- status: PASS
- severity: none
- reviewed_at: 2026-05-16T14:19:22Z
- criterion_failed: none
- evidence: |
  bash -n passes with RANK_OK.
  max_risk LOW HIGH → HIGH ✓
  max_risk HIGH UNKNOWN → UNKNOWN ✓
  max_risk MEDIUM LOW → MEDIUM ✓
  Script implements: rank() mapping LOW=0 MEDIUM=1 HIGH=2 UNKNOWN=3, max_risk() via arithmetic comparison, exit-code constants in comments.
- fix_hint: N/A
- resolved_at: 2026-05-16T14:19:22Z

### [task-1.3] [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: skeleton syntax + arg contract
- status: PASS
- severity: none
- reviewed_at: 2026-05-16T14:22:43Z
- criterion_failed: none
- evidence: |
  bash -n passes with CHECKPOINT_OK. Script passes syntax check.
- fix_hint: N/A
- resolved_at: 2026-05-16T14:22:43Z

### [task-1.4] Implement Layer 1 — locate and extract the Access Matrix table
- status: PASS
- severity: none
- reviewed_at: 2026-05-16T14:29:17Z
- criterion_failed: none
- evidence: |
  bash -n passes with L1_EXTRACT_OK.
  Function layer1_role_contract() added (lines 77-264):
  - Resolves references/role-contracts.md relative to CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT (or script dir fallback)
  - Returns UNKNOWN if file missing (lines 97-100)
  - Uses awk to extract Access Matrix table (lines 103-113)
  - Returns UNKNOWN if table not found (lines 110-113)
  bash -n syntax check passes.
  Note: function is defined but not yet wired to main flow (Phase 1 tasks build layer-by-layer).
- fix_hint: N/A
- resolved_at: 2026-05-16T14:29:17Z

### [task-1.5] Implement Layer 1 — agent-row lookup
- status: PASS
- severity: none
- reviewed_at: 2026-05-16T14:32:59Z
- criterion_failed: none
- evidence: |
  Agent-row lookup implemented in layer1_role_contract() (lines 115-159):
  - Parses pipe-delimited table rows, trims cells with xargs (lines 120-143)
  - Case-insensitive agent match (line 145: ${c_role,,} == ${role,,})
  - Captures Writes and Denylist cells (lines 146-149)
  - Returns UNKNOWN if agent not found (lines 156-159)
  bash -n syntax check passes.
- fix_hint: N/A
- resolved_at: 2026-05-16T14:32:59Z

### [task-1.6] Implement Layer 1 — glob path matching and hard-block verdict
- status: PASS
- severity: minor
- reviewed_at: 2026-05-16T14:36:27Z
- criterion_failed: minor — shopt -s extglob not explicitly enabled per spec task description
- evidence: |
  Glob path matching implemented (lines 161-251):
  - Denylist check: for each path, tests against each Denylist pattern (lines 172-198)
  - Writes check: if path NOT in Writes patterns → violation (lines 200-249)
  - Glob conversion to regex: sed-based conversion (lines 238-242) for write pattern matching
  - Output: RISK:clear|REASON:... or RISK:violation|REASON:... (lines 253-262)
  bash -n passes with L1_MATCH_OK.
  Note: task spec says "enable shopt -s extglob" but code relies on bash [[ ]] glob matching
  which works for basic globs without explicit extglob enablement. Minor deviation, not a FAIL.
- fix_hint: Consider adding `shopt -s extglob` at function start for spec compliance (optional)
- resolved_at: 2026-05-16T14:36:27Z

### [task-1.7] [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint: Layer 1 logic

- fix_hint: N/A
- resolved_at: 2026-05-16T14:40:17Z
