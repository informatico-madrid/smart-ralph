# Ralph Specum

Spec-driven development with smart compaction. A Claude Code plugin that combines the Ralph Wiggum agentic loop with structured specification workflow.

## Features

- **Spec-Driven Workflow**: Automatically generates requirements, design, and tasks from a goal description
- **Smart Compaction**: Strategic context management between phases and tasks
- **Persistent Progress**: Learnings and state survive compaction via progress file
- **Two Modes**: Interactive (pause per phase) or fully autonomous
- **BMAD Bridge**: Import BMAD planning artifacts (PRD, epics, architecture) into ralphharness specs via `/ralph-bmad:import`
- **Loop Safety**: Pre-loop git checkpoint, circuit breaker, per-task metrics, and read-only detection
- **Role Boundaries**: Mechanical enforcement of file access rules per agent role

## Installation

### From Marketplace (Recommended)

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add informatico-madrid/ralphharness

# Install the plugin
/plugin install ralphharness@ralphharness

# Restart Claude Code to load
```

### From GitHub Repository

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/informatico-madrid/ralphharness.git

# Install from local path
/plugin install /path/to/ralphharness

# Or install directly from GitHub
/plugin install https://github.com/informatico-madrid/ralphharness
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone and link for development
git clone https://github.com/informatico-madrid/ralphharness.git
cd ralphharness
/plugin install .
```

## Packaged Distribution

When installed via the Codex-packaged distribution (`ralphharness-codex`), commands are exposed with the `ralphharness-` prefix:

```
$ralphharness-triage "Build a multi-tenant SaaS platform"
$ralphharness-research
$ralphharness-requirements
$ralphharness-design
$ralphharness-tasks
$ralphharness-implement
$ralphharness-start my-feature "Build user authentication"
$ralphharness-cancel
$ralphharness-status
$ralphharness-feedback
$ralphharness-help
$ralphharness-index
$ralphharness-refactor
$ralphharness-rollback
$ralphharness-switch
```

See the [Codex plugin README](plugins/ralphharness-codex/README.md) for full Codex-specific documentation.

## Quick Start

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)

```
/ralphharness "Add user authentication with JWT tokens" --mode interactive --dir ./auth-spec
```

This will:
1. Generate `requirements.md` and pause for approval
2. After `/ralphharness:approve`, generate `design.md` and pause
3. After approval, generate `tasks.md` and pause
4. After approval, execute all tasks (compacting after each)

### Autonomous Mode

```bash
# The smart way (auto-detects resume or new)
/ralphharness:start user-auth Add JWT authentication

# Quick mode (skip spec phases, auto-generate everything)
/ralphharness:start "Add user auth" --quick

# The step-by-step way
/ralphharness:new user-auth Add JWT authentication
/ralphharness:requirements
/ralphharness:design
/ralphharness:tasks
/ralphharness:implement
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ralphharness "goal" [options]` | Start the spec-driven loop |
| `/ralphharness:approve` | Approve current phase (interactive mode) |
| `/ralphharness:cancel` | Cancel active loop and cleanup |
| `/ralphharness:feedback` | Collect and process user feedback |
| `/ralphharness:help` | Show help |
| `/ralphharness:index` | Index/rebuild spec directory |
| `/ralphharness:refactor` | Refactor existing spec |
| `/ralphharness:rollback` | Rollback to git checkpoint |
| `/ralphharness:switch` | Switch to another spec |

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Input
        G[Goal Description]
    end

    subgraph Spec["Specification Phases"]
        R[Requirements]
        D[Design]
        T[Tasks]
    end

    subgraph Exec["Execution Phase"]
        E1[Task 1]
        E2[Task 2]
        EN[Task N]
    end

    subgraph Output
        C[Complete]
    end

    G --> R
    R -->|compact| D
    D -->|compact| T
    T -->|compact| E1
    E1 -->|compact| E2
    E2 -->|compact| EN
    EN --> C

    R -.->|interactive| A1{Approve?}
    D -.->|interactive| A2{Approve?}
    T -.->|interactive| A3{Approve?}

    A1 -->|yes| D
    A2 -->|yes| T
    A3 -->|yes| E1
```

### State Management

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Files["Persistent State"]
        P[".ralph-progress.md<br/>Learnings & Progress"]
        S[".ralph-state.json<br/>Loop State"]
    end

    subgraph Compaction
        CM[Context Window<br/>Management]
    end

    P -->|survives| CM
    S -->|tracks| CM
    CM -->|preserves key context| P
```

### Smart Compaction

Each phase transition uses targeted compaction:

| Phase | Preserves |
|-------|-----------|
| Requirements | User stories, acceptance criteria, FR/NFR, glossary |
| Design | Architecture, patterns, file paths |
| Tasks | Task list, dependencies, quality gates |
| Per-task | Current task context only |

### Progress File

The `.ralph-progress.md` file carries state across compactions:

```markdown
# Ralph Progress

## Current Goal
**Phase**: execution
**Task**: 3/7 - Implement auth flow
**Objective**: Create login/logout endpoints

## Completed
- [x] Task 1: Setup scaffolding
- [x] Task 2: Database schema
- [ ] Task 3: Auth flow (IN PROGRESS)

## Learnings
- Project uses Zod for validation
- Rate limiting exists in middleware/

## Next Steps
1. Complete JWT generation
2. Add refresh tokens
```

## Files Generated

In your spec directory:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `requirements.md` | User stories, acceptance criteria |
| `design.md` | Architecture, patterns, file matrix |
| `tasks.md` | Phased task breakdown |
| `.ralph-state.json` | Loop state (deleted on completion) |
| `.ralph-progress.md` | Progress and learnings (deleted on completion) |

## Configuration

### Max Iterations

Default: 50 iterations. The loop stops if this limit is reached to prevent infinite loops.

### Templates

Templates in `templates/` can be customized for your project's needs.

## Troubleshooting

### Loop not continuing?

1. Check if in interactive mode waiting for `/ralphharness:approve`
2. Verify `.ralph-state.json` exists in spec directory
3. Check iteration count hasn't exceeded max

### Lost context after compaction?

1. Check `.ralph-progress.md` for preserved state
2. Learnings should persist across compactions
3. The skill always reads progress file first

### Cancel and restart?

```
/ralphharness:cancel --dir ./your-spec
/ralphharness "your goal" --dir ./your-spec
```
