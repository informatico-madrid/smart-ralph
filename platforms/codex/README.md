## Recommended Install Sets

### Core Install

Install the primary skill only. This is the easiest path.

Prompt to send to Codex:

```text
Use $skill-installer to install the RalphHarness Codex skill from repo `informatico-madrid/ralphharness` at path `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness`.
First ask whether to install globally under `$CODEX_HOME/skills` or project-local inside this repo.
Before installing, check whether an existing install already has a `manifest.json` version for RalphHarness Codex.
Compare that installed version to `platforms/codex/manifest.json` in this repo.
If no install exists or the versions differ, run the installer for the selected target.
If the versions match, say it is already up to date and skip reinstalling.
```

In Codex, ask `$skill-installer` to install:

- repo: `informatico-madrid/ralphharness`
- path: `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness`

Direct script form:

```bash
python3 "$CODEX_HOME/skills/.system/skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py" \
  --repo informatico-madrid/ralphharness \
  --path platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness
```

### Full Helper Bundle

### Update Existing Install

Prompt to send to Codex:

```text
Use $skill-installer to update the RalphHarness Codex install from repo `informatico-madrid/ralphharness`.
First ask whether the current install lives globally under `$CODEX_HOME/skills` or project-local inside this repo.
Check the installed RalphHarness Codex `manifest.json` version and compare it to `platforms/codex/manifest.json` in this repo.
Only if the versions differ, reinstall these paths into the selected target:
- `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness`
- `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness-start`
- `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness-triage`
- `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness-research`
- `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness-requirements`
- `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness-design`
- `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness-tasks`
- `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness-implement`
- `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness-status`
- `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness-switch`
- `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness-cancel`
- `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness-index`
- `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness-refactor`
- `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness-feedback`
- `platforms/codex/skills/ralphharness-help`
If the versions match, say it is already up to date and do not reinstall.
Then restart Codex.
```

## Optional Project Bootstrap

The package does not require project-local files. If a team wants repo-local guidance, copy these optional templates from the installed primary skill:

- `$CODEX_HOME/skills/ralphharness/assets/bootstrap/AGENTS.md`
- `$CODEX_HOME/skills/ralphharness/assets/bootstrap/ralphharness.local.md`

Recommended destinations in the consumer repo:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `.claude/ralphharness.local.md`

## Parity Notes

- Claude plugin manifests and hooks do not exist in Codex.
- Quick mode is expressed as one Codex run that generates missing artifacts and then continues into implementation.
- Claude stop-hook continuation is replaced by `.ralph-state.json` persistence and resume behavior.
- Task approval gates, `--tasks-size` granularity, VE verification tasks, and `[P]` or `[VERIFY]` task markers are part of the current Codex-facing guidance.
- Large efforts should route through triage first. Epic state lives under `specs/_epics/` with `specs/.current-epic` tracking the active epic.
- Branch and worktree decisions are still available, but they are handled conversationally instead of through Claude plugin prompts.
- Helper skills are explicit entrypoints. The primary skill remains the best default.
- Ralph does not self-advance by default. After each spec artifact, the user must approve it, request changes, or explicitly continue to the next step.
- Quick or autonomous flow happens only when the user explicitly asks for it.

## Maintainer Notes

- Any change under `platforms/codex/` must bump `platforms/codex/manifest.json`.
- Skill sources live under `platforms/codex/skills/`.
- The primary skill contains the shared references, scripts, bootstrap assets, and canonical templates.
- Helper skills are standalone install units. They must not depend on files outside their own installed directory.
